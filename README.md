# Resources
This repo contain a collection of materials for learning that can help you get up to speed with the Ruby programming language from the basic building blocks upto to the various frameworks and tools in the Ruby ecosystem.

I have marked resources which I particularly recommend with a *, as well as comments on when I think it would be best for you to consult these resources, so that will whittle things down a little.

If you want to add your own resources, [fork this repo](https://github.com/msaruby/Resources) and send in a pull request. :+1:
