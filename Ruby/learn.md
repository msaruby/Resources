## Ruby

* [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/) *
    - An interactive Ruby tutorial, with good exercises, and different tracks covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics
* [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
    - different from typical coding tutorials; this one exposes you to various aspects of Ruby as well as the idea of *unit tests*
* [Learn Ruby (Test-First)](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) *
    - good set of Ruby exercises that also introduce you to unit tests (written in RSpec) and *test-driven development* (TDD). Definitely check this out. It's not too long either.
* [Programming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby)
    - also known as the Pickaxe book; it seems to be known as *the* Ruby book. Good for reference and digging deeper, but not free.
